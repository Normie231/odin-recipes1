    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Black Forest gâteau (German: Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte literally "Black Forest Cherry-torte"), also called Black Forest cake (North American English), is a German chocolate and cream cake with a rich cherry filling. While it is most likely based on a Black Forest dessert tradition, the cake's specific origin in Germany is contested.</p>

    <p>Typically, Black Forest gateau consists of several layers of chocolate sponge cake sandwiched with whipped cream and cherries. It is decorated with additional whipped cream, maraschino cherries, and chocolate shavings. In some European traditions, sour cherries are used both between the layers and for decorating the top. Traditionally the alcoholic Kirschwasser, a clear spirit made from sour cherries, is added to the cake. Other spirits are sometimes used, such as rum, which is common in Austrian recipes. German law mandates that any dessert labeled Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte must have Kirschwasser</p>
<h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li><h2>STEP 1:</h2></li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans; line bottoms with parchment paper. Place a medium bowl in the refrigerator to chill.</p>
    <li><h2>STEP 2:</h2></li>
    <p>Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; beat until combined. Pour cake batter into the prepared pans.</p>
    <li><h2>STEP 3:</h2></li>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool layers in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Run a paring knife around edges to loosen and invert carefully onto racks to cool completely, 1 to 2 hours.</p>
    <li><h2>STEP 4:</h2></li>
<p>While cake layers bake, drain cherries for topping, reserving 1/2 cup juice. Combine reserved juice, cherries, sugar, and cornstarch in a 2-quart saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until thickened. Stir in vanilla. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely before assembling cake.</p>
